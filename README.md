# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows players to compete against the computer, keeping track of scores until one player wins five rounds. The main goal of this project was to learn the basics of JavaScript, including functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking buttons.
- **Computer Opponent**: The computer randomly selects its choice.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of both the player's and computer's scores.
- **Round Result Display**: Displays the outcome of each round with color-coded messages.
- **Game Reset**: Automatically resets the scores when one player wins five rounds.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Adds basic styling and layout for the buttons and result display.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, random choice generation, and user interactions.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling
└── script.js           # JavaScript file for game logic
```

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand the **basics of JavaScript**. Key concepts and skills learned include:

- Using **functions** for game logic and random choice generation.
- Handling **user input** through button click events.
- Manipulating the **DOM** to update the game state and display results dynamically.
- Implementing **conditional statements** for game logic and determining the winner.
- Using **variables** to store and update the player's and computer's scores.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on one of the buttons: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
3. The game will display the result of the round and update the scores:
   - The first player to reach **5 points** wins the game.
   - The game resets automatically after a winner is determined.
4. Have fun and try to beat the computer!

## Future Improvements

- Add a **sound effect** for each choice and result.
- Implement a **dark mode** toggle for better visual appeal.
- Add an **animation effect** when displaying the round result.
- Include a **best-of-three** mode for a shorter game experience.
